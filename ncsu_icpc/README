Overview
========
This is a small repository for NCSU's ICPC code. This way we can already have it written up and
printed off when the competition starts.

Test Explanation
================
Prim's
------
    Prim's is a simple MST finding algorithm. The input format is as follows:
    The first line will contain an integer n, the number of edges to follow.
    Then n edges will follow, each edge denoted by the two node IDs, followed
    by the edge weight, all separated by spaces. There can be multiple test
    cases in a row, and the input will be ended with a test case where there are
    0 edges. See the test input and output for an example.
